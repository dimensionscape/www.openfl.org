OpenFL uses the Lime project file format.

The most common file name is _project.xml_, but valid file extensions include _.xml_, _.lime_ or _.hxp_

For more information on the standard XML format (which includes \*.lime), read more in the Lime documentation:

 * [XML Format](https://lime.openfl.org/docs/project-files/xml-format/) (Lime)

The HXP file format is a special format which is written using Haxe, rather than XML. It is very powerful, but may be less reliable than XML project files. For more information, read more in the Lime documentation:
