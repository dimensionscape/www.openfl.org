_Welcome!_ [OpenFL](/) is a library for creative expression on the web, desktop, and mobile that can publish to native C++, JS and WebGL, and run-times like HashLink and Adobe AIR using one seamless toolset.

## First Steps

To get started, be sure that you [download and install OpenFL.](/download/)

Then, you can get up and running with the included [sample projects](docs/command-line-tools/samples/), or you can create your own project by [following a tutorial](http://localhost:4000/learn/haxelib/tutorials/) or by using a [blank project template](docs/command-line-tools/create-new-project/).

## Fundamentals

If you are already familiar with Adobe Flash development with ActionScript 3.0, you should feel right at home with OpenFL. If you have never developed using ActionScript 3.0 or Flash before, that's okay because we offer the [OpenFL Developer's Guide](https://books.openfl.org/openfl-developers-guide/) to introduce you to some of the key concepts, classes and interfaces, and other APIs. You'll learn the fundamentals of [working with display objects](https://books.openfl.org/openfl-developers-guide/display-programming/), [listening for events](https://books.openfl.org/openfl-developers-guide/handling-events/), [drawing lines, curves, and shapes](https://books.openfl.org/openfl-developers-guide/using-the-drawing-api/), and much more.
