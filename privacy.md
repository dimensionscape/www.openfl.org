_Effective April 1, 2013_

This page sets forth the privacy policies and practices of OpenFL community site [www.openfl.org](https://www.openfl.org). Please read this Privacy Policy carefully since by visiting this site and sharing information with OpenFL you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.

## I. Information We Collect, Consumer Choice and Access

The only personal information that OpenFL collects is when a consumer seeks information from OpenFL and contacts OpenFL on his/her own accord by e-mail or through a contact form or otherwise.

Primarily, we will use your personal information to administer your inquiries, and may also use it to contact you with OpenFL newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, you may email us at [privacy@openfl.org](mailto:privacy@openfl.org) and request that you be removed from our database.

## II. Information Management

OpenFL may share information with its affiliated entities for or in connection with the sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial asset, reorganization or liquidation of any of the OpenFL companies. OpenFL also may release information when we believe release is appropriate to respond to a subpoena or otherwise comply with the law; enforce or apply our agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of OpenFL or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection.

## III. Security

While we strive to protect your information, OpenFL cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. No transmission of data over the Internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under the control of OpenFL to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully. You acknowledge and assume this risk when communicating with us.

## IV. Consent and Changes

OpenFL may find it necessary or be legally obligated to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the effective date so that you are always aware of the information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.

## V. Data Processing/Safe Harbor

The European Union ("EU") maintains strict privacy laws. These rules differ significantly from the laws of the United States of America (“US”). To reconcile these differences, the US and the EU have created a safe harbor (“Safe Harbor”) that defines mutually acceptable privacy operations. For more information see www.export.gov/safeharbor. Please check such applicable US subsidiaries or affiliates’ website privacy policies for information on such companies’ Safe Harbor certifications.

## VI. Limitation of Liability, Third Party Information & Language

YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE OVER THE PRIVACY OF OPENFL DATA OR OPENFL'S PRACTICES IS SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND ANY APPLICABLE TERMS AND CONDITIONS (WHICH MAY INCLUDE LIMITATIONS ON DAMAGES AND/OR ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES). YOU AGREE THAT OPENFL'S LIABILITY FOR ANY BREACH OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF THE VALUE OF THE TRANSACTIONS OR SERVICES PROVIDED TO YOU BY OPENFL OR $50 TO THE EXTENT SUCH CLAIM IS NOT OTHERWISE BARRED BY OUR TERMS AND CONDITIONS. YOU FURTHER AGREE THAT THIS AGREEMENT IS GOVERNED BY CALIFORNIA LAW WITHOUT REGARD TO CHOICE OF LAW PRINCIPLES AND THAT ANY ACTION ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIS POLICY WILL BE EXCLUSIVELY VENUED IN A STATE OR FEDERAL COURT SITUATED IN EL DORADO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA.
